### Hi nerds ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Andrea Licheri, and I'm an high-school student. In case it wasn't clear already, I'm italian.
- I have knowledge of Python, and eventually when it comes to static typing, of Nim. I do also some security research on my free time. 
- Maybe in the future I will add my curriculum to this README. See ya.
